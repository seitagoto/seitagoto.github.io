			<p>I am a graphic designer based in Ottawa, Canada and I'm currently in my final year studying
			at Algonquin College. I believe in reptilian conspiracies and likes to cook
			while watching cartoons and documentaries. My main focuses include hand-done typography
			and illustration, as well as photography. I want to create something that's not just
			a pretty picture but designs that people can connect to emotionally.</p>

			My actual website is in progress. In the meantime please see my works in the <br class="orphan">links below.
